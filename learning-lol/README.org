* Learning the Lol lib
** Lol docs
   - Lol docs on [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lol][hackage]]
   - Lol repo on [[https://github.com/cpeikert/Lol][github]]
   - Lol docs [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1134.pdf][paper]]

* First steps
** Pre-recs
   You need to install cabal and stack. There are several ways to do it, I think installing [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#][ghcup]] is enough.
   For better use of LSP on your editor etc I've downloaded also these packages:
   #+begin_src shell :exports both 
     cabal install apply-refact hlint stylish-haskell hasktags hoogle hindent implicit-hie
   #+end_src
  
** Steps
*** Creating a project with stack
    - Checkout docs https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/
    - ~stack new [your-project-name] new-template~
*** To enhance your project configs
    - Install [[https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie][implicit-hie]]
      - ~stack install implicit-hie~
    - In your project root:
      - ~gen-hie > hie.yaml~
*** Add Lol to the project
    - Clone the repo somewhere on your machine
      #+begin_src shell :exports both 
        git clone https://github.com/cpeikert/Lol.git 
      #+end_src
    - Copy the entire ~Lol/lol~ dir to your ~your-project/src~
    - On your projects' ~package.yaml~ change the resolver and add lol and the project itself to the packages item:
      #+begin_src yaml :exports both 
        resolver: lts-17.5
        compiler-check: newer-minor
        
        packages:
          - src/lol
          - '.'
      #+end_src
    - On your ~package.yaml~, change the base version to fit the lol lib:
      #+begin_src yaml :exports both 
          dependencies:
            - base >= 4.14 && < 4.15
        
      #+end_src
      - Build the project
        #+begin_src shell :exports both 
          stack build
        #+end_src
        It will probably ask for you to add ~monadcryptorandom~ hash on your ~stack.yaml~'s ~extra-deps~:
        #+begin_src yaml :exports both 
            extra-deps:
              - monadcryptorandom-0.7.2.1@sha256:b0e739271f4fd015ce81a411322de1ce36f9861886c2754276750aa399a610b2,1349
          
        #+end_src
        After that ~stack build~ should work!
